# Jira-Ticket-Escalation

For this project, I'll demonstrate how to escalate a ticket using Jira 

Step 1: Login and open your Jira service account. I created a ticket for this demonstration. If you don't have any tickets from the default configuration, go to 'Raise a request' to create a new ticket like I did

Step 2: Click on the ticket > Click on 'Open' tab on the top right corner > select 'start work' >

Step 3: At the bottom go to 'Activity' . 'Comments' > 'Reply to customer'. Create a response to let the customer know that the ticket is being taken care of.

Step 4: Create an internal note as this ticket is going to be redirected to the hardware department specialist.

Step 5: On the 'Details' section, change the assignee to the appriopriate person the ticket will be escalated to. Note: I can't create new users so this will be in theory.

This concludes this project on escalating tickets to the appropriate channels/people
